The cloud is leaking. 

For the last decade, we have been trading convenience for custody. We gave our photos to Google, our thoughts to Twitter, and our documents to Microsoft.

Now, we are giving our cognition to AI models.

## The Problem
Every time you use ChatGPT or Claude, you are renting your own intelligence. The insights you generate, the code you write, the conversations you have. They live on a server you cannot touch, governed by a policy you did not write.

## The Solution: BASE
BASE is a return to first principles. It is a local-first vault that sits on your hardware.

1. **Ingest:** It pulls your history from the cloud.
2. **Index:** It makes everything searchable locally.
3. **Protect:** It encrypts your data at rest.

We are not building a better cloud. We are building a bunker.
