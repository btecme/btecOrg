Entropy is the default state of the universe. Without active energy input, order dissolves into chaos.

In the digital realm, this manifests as "Data Sprawl."

## The Liability of Noise
Most organizations believe that hoarding data is an asset strategy. They are wrong. Unstructured, unindexed, and sovereign-less data is a liability. 

When you cannot find the signal, you are just paying to store the noise.

## The Alignment Problem
Before you can automate a system, you must define it. AI cannot fix a broken process; it will only accelerate the error.

At **b-tec**, we define "Alignment" not just as AI safety, but as organizational clarity.
1. **Structure:** Define the schema of your reality.
2. **Sovereignty:** Own the keys to that schema.
3. **Speed:** Only then can you accelerate.

If your foundation is chaos, your future is collapse.
