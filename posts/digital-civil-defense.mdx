The era of the "passive internet user" is over. 

We are entering an adversarial age where the primary threats to your cognition are algorithmic. To survive 2026 and beyond, you must adopt a posture of **Civil Defense**.

## 1. The Air Gap
If it is important, it cannot live solely on the cloud. The cloud is someone else's computer, and they can lock the doors at any time. You need a local backup of your digital life (images, documents, code, and chat history).

## 2. The Identity Layer
Deepfakes will soon render digital video and audio inadmissible as proof of humanity. We need new cryptographic proofs of identity. Start organizing your PGP keys and hardware tokens now.

## 3. The Sovereign Vault
This is why we are building **BASE**. Not because we hate the cloud, but because we respect the storm. You need a bunker that holds your history, accessible even when the internet goes dark.

Build your defenses before the rain starts.
