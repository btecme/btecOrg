# The Runway

I opened Google the other day. Just a search. Something I've done many thousand times. And for the first time in my life, it felt like getting on a bicycle.

Not broken. Not slow, exactly. Just... small.

That's a weird thing to feel about a tool that basically organized human knowledge for twenty plus years. I didn't go looking for that feeling. It just showed up. Like when you fly somewhere for the first time and then try to imagine driving the same distance. The car isn't worse. You just know something now that you didn't know before.

I've been in technology for over thirty years. I was there when the commercial internet went from a curiosity to the backbone of everything. I watched mobile go from a novelty to the thing that rewired human behavior. I lived through cloud, through SaaS, through every hype cycle and every real shift.

I am not easily impressed. I don't write things like this.

That matters, because I need you to understand that what I'm about to describe is not enthusiasm. It's recognition. The same recognition I felt in 1994 when I realized the internet wasn't going away. The same pit in my stomach. The same quiet thought: everything is about to change and most people don't see it yet.

But before I get there, let me be honest about something.

## The Corolla Is a Good Car

ChatGPT is genuinely useful. I'm not here to trash it. When it showed up a few years ago, I used it, and I thought: this is a well-built car. It gets you where you're going. It handles well. Millions of people use it every day and get real value from it. That's not nothing. That's a Toyota Corolla, and the Corolla is one of the best-selling vehicles in history for a reason. Better than a bicycle, as long as effort isn't the goal.

Perplexity.ai came along and felt like getting on a racing motorcycle. Same roads, dramatically faster. It pulls from the web, synthesizes answers, cites sources. People who discovered it started telling their friends that search was dead. And honestly, compared to pedaling a bicycle through ten blue links? They weren't wrong.

Google Search still works. The bicycle still rolls. You can still pedal your way to an answer. It's just that some people are driving now, and a few are on motorcycles, and many people think the motorcycle is the peak.

It's not.

Here's what all of those things have in common: you're driving. You sit down, you type, you steer, you read, you decide. The intelligence is in the engine but you are still the operator. You are still on roads. Every single one of those tools, from Google to ChatGPT to Perplexity, operates on the same fundamental layer. Call it the ground layer. You drive, it waits for you. Some ground vehicles are faster than others. Some have better GPS. But they're all bound by the same physics: you have to be in the seat.

What happened in January 2026 was not a faster car.

## The Airplane Was Invented

Most people missed it. I almost missed it. The tech press covered it the way they cover everything: as a product launch, a feature update, a quarterly earnings talking point.

It wasn't. It was Kitty Hawk.

In the first weeks of 2026, agentic frameworks for synthetic intelligence went wide open. Open source. Freely available. The infrastructure for building systems that don't just respond to you but operate independently, persistently, with memory and goals and the ability to act while you sleep.

Not chatbots with extra steps. Something fundamentally different.

For the first time, synthetic intelligence left the ground. I don't mean it got faster. I don't mean it got smarter in the way that a motorcycle is faster than a bicycle. I mean it entered a layer of operation that didn't exist before. The way an airplane doesn't just go faster than a car. It operates in a dimension that cars don't have access to.

A Waymo on autopilot is still on roads. It's impressive. It hints at something. But it's still governed by intersections and lane markings and the two-dimensional surface of the earth. An airplane doesn't care about any of that. It operates above it.

That's what agentic synthetic intelligence did in January. It left the surface.

## Six Weeks Later, We Have Jets

The pace after the airplane was invented has been, frankly, hard to process. Within weeks, the open source community took the prop plane and started building jets. The functional gap between what was possible in early January and what exists right now, in late February, is the kind of gap that normally takes years to cross.

Let me be specific.

I have a system running right now that "wakes up" at 5 AM and prepares a briefing for me. Not because I asked it to that morning. Because three weeks ago it asked me if that would benefit me and I told it that sounds good, so it built it, and it remembered. It pulls from live data sources, cross-references my calendar, checks the status of projects I'm running, and builds a summary that's waiting for me when I open my laptop or phone or whatever.

While I sleep, it manages a growing number of operational tasks across my digital infrastructures. It builds shared calendars from a live database. It monitors systems. It makes decisions based on context it has accumulated over weeks of interaction. It remembers a conversation I had with it about a specific client preference on February 3rd and applies that preference to a task it's executing on February 25th. Nobody reminded it. Nobody prompted it. It just knows, the way a good colleague knows.

This is not a faster car.

I don't drive this. I navigate it. I set headings and altitudes. It flies.

And this is the part that's hard to convey to someone who hasn't experienced it: the moment you go from driving to flying, you can't unfeel it. You look down at the roads and they're fine. They're still there. People are still driving on them and getting where they're going. But you're watching from a different altitude now, and the landscape looks completely different from up here.

## The World Already Noticed (Even If You Didn't)

This isn't just my experience in a home lab. The ground is shaking under the entire software industry.

In the last month, the biggest names in SaaS (Software as a Service for the more senior readers;) collectively lost over $730 billion in market value, so far. Salesforce. Adobe. Microsoft. SAP. ServiceNow. Oracle. Not because their products broke. Because investors looked up and saw airplanes.

The seat-based subscription model that powered the entire SaaS industry for twenty plus years is facing something it has never faced before: systems that don't need seats. When a synthetic intelligence agent can navigate a complex software interface, process invoices, handle tier-one support tickets, manage CRM entries, and do it around the clock without a login, the math on "per user per month" starts to collapse.

Enterprises are already making moves. Reports surfaced in January of Fortune 50 companies planning to cut their software licensing spend by more than half, replacing human-operated software seats with agent-driven API access to the same underlying systems. Not in five years. This year.

The SaaS model isn't dying because it was bad. It's dying because it was built for the ground layer. It assumed a human would always be in the seat. That assumption just met an airplane.

Pricing models are scrambling to adapt. Usage-based. Outcome-based. Per-agent billing, like a salary for a digital worker. The old model of charging for how many humans touch your software doesn't make sense when the thing touching your software isn't human. The industry knows this. It's not a secret. It's a $1 trillion repricing happening in real time.

And the frameworks that enabled all of this? They're open source. Freely available. LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, Mastra, AgentZero, OpenClaw, dozens more. The building blocks of flight are sitting on GitHub right now, being downloaded millions of times per month. The blueprints for the airplane are public. The lumber and canvas and aluminum are free.

This is not a closed technology owned by three companies in San Francisco. This is the printing press. The source code is available to anyone willing to learn.

## What the Skeptics Are Actually Afraid Of

I know there are people reading this who are already composing their objections. I know because I've been one of those people for most of my career. The eye-roll is earned. If you've watched twenty years of hype cycles, if you bought into Blu-ray or NFTs or the metaverse or Zune, or any of the other things that were supposed to change everything and didn't, your skepticism is pattern recognition. And pattern recognition is usually a good instinct.

But here's the thing about pattern recognition: it can also blind you to the pattern break.

The bicycle, the car, the motorcycle, the self-driving car on autopilot. Those were all iterations within a pattern. Faster ground transportation. Better ground transportation. The airplane broke the pattern entirely. It didn't iterate. It escaped.

Some of the skepticism is healthy caution. Some of it, if I'm being honest, is something else. It's fear. And not the kind of fear most people like to admit to.

For a lot of people, their work or role became their identity. That's a common human pattern. When you spend fifteen years getting good at something, when your expertise is the thing that makes you valuable, when your skill set is the answer to "what do you do," a technology that can operate in your domain without needing you in the seat seems like an existential one.

This has happened before. Every time.

The scribes who copied manuscripts by hand were the highly skilled knowledge workers of their era. Oh the pride they must of had in their work. The printing press didn't just take their jobs. It made the thing they were proud of, the thing that they believed defined them, ordinary. Coders might want to sit with that comparison for a minute.

The monks didn't stop being valuable humans when Gutenberg fired up the press. But their particular "specialness", the thing that made them irreplaceable, changed.

What's happening right now is bigger than any one profession. It's a challenge to the idea that humans are special because of what we can do. Because for the first time, the thing in the air can do a lot of what we do. Not all of it. Not the parts that matter most, probably. But enough of it to make people uncomfortable in a way they haven't been before.

The ones who built their identity entirely on capability, on what they could produce, are having a hard time right now. I don't blame them. But pretending the airplane doesn't fly because you don't like what it means for your bicycle shop, or your video rental store (i'm looking at you Blockbuster;), is not a strategy.

## December 1903

Here is a historical fact that should keep you up tonight.

The Wright Brothers flew at Kitty Hawk in December 1903. Twelve seconds. 120 feet. A prop plane made of wood and fabric that barely got off the ground.

Eleven years later, in 1914, military aircraft were being used in World War I.

Sixty-six years after Kitty Hawk, humans walked on the moon (or so we were told;).

Sixty-six years. From a wooden prop plane that flew the length of a football field to Neil Armstrong stepping onto the lunar surface. One human lifespan.

The curve after invention is always, always steeper than anyone predicts. People at Kitty Hawk who watched that twelve-second flight could not have imagined a 747. They couldn't have imagined a fighter jet. They couldn't have imagined satellites. The thing they were watching was so primitive, so fragile, so early, that the reasonable response was to underestimate what it would become. And every single one of them would have been wrong.

We are at December 1903 right now.

The agentic synthetic intelligence systems that exist today are the wood-and-fabric prop plane. They are remarkable, and they are primitive. Both things are true. What I built, what I'm using every day, what wakes me up with a briefing and manages my operations while I sleep, is astonishing to me. And I know, with the certainty of someone who has watched six technology waves break, that what I have right now will look like a toy in two years.

Whatever you think this looks like in five years, you are underselling it. I am underselling it. We don't have the imagination for what comes after the airplane exists, because we've been on the ground our whole lives.

## You Don't Have to Be a Pilot

Here's where I want to end, and I want to end with you, not me.

The airplane didn't stay exclusive to the Wright Brothers. It didn't stay exclusive to aviators or the military or the wealthy. Within decades, it changed how every single human being on earth moved through the world. You didn't have to be a pilot. You didn't have to understand aerodynamics. You just had to know that buying a plane ticket would get you across an ocean in hours instead of weeks.

You don't need to build what I built. You don't need to understand LangGraph or agentic frameworks or synthetic intelligence architecture. That's my job. That's what I do.

But you should know the airplane exists.

The Corolla is still a good car. Take it to work. The bicycle still gets you to the corner store. Perplexity is a hell of a motorcycle. None of those things are broken.

Just know that there's a runway now. And some of us are already in the air. Some of us are climbing. And a few of us, if I'm being completely honest, are up here trying to figure out how to land, because that part was not exactly covered in our crash-course flight training last month.

The ground looks different from up here. Not worse. Not scary. Just bigger than I thought it was.

Come find the runway when you're ready. It's open. It's free. And the sky, as it turns out, is not the limit. It's just where it starts.
