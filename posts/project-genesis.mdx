The idea for BASE didn't start with a manifesto. It started with a frustration.

I was testing the early release of **Gemini 3**, considering making it my new "daily driver" for utility AI. But as I sat there ready to switch, I looked back at my ChatGPT history. 

Years of context. Custom instructions. Memory. Fine-tuned GPTs.

I wasn't just switching tools; I was leaving behind a digital lobe of my brain.

## The Migration Problem
I started sketching a utility to migrate that data. A simple script to pull history from OpenAI and push it to Google.

But within an hour, I realized that was the wrong approach. Why move from one walled garden to another? If I migrated today, I'd just have to do it again when Claude 4.5 or Llama 5 drops.

I didn't need a migration tool. I needed a **repo**.

## Git for Human-AI Cognition
Software developers solved this problem decades ago. We don't store our code in the cloud editor; we store it in Git. We own the source, and we push/pull to whatever service we need.

Why don't we do this for our thoughts?

This was the spark for **BASE**. 
* **Modular:** Connectors for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and local LLMs.
* **Resilient:** Designed to withstand the "threat waves" of increasing internet noise and predation.
* **Simple:** The Vault is just a single folder on your hard drive. 

## The Architecture
The design is intentionally boring. No proprietary databases. No complex cloud syncing logic. Just files, folders, and standard formats.

We are building a future P2P mesh for syncing, but the core unit will always be that portable, local folder. 

You own the bits. The platforms are just guests.
